Gesture Recognition using Leap Motion Controller

It is always challenging for deaf and speech-impaired people to communicate with non-sign
language users. A real-time sign language recognition system using 3D motion sensors could
lower the afore mentioned communication barrier. We have developed a real-time multi-
sensor recognition system for Indian sign language (ISL).

A sign language recognition system is used to bring the speech-impaired and the hearing-
impaired community closer to more regular and convenient forms of communication. Thus,
this system requires recognizing the gesture from sign language and convert them to form
that are understandable by hearing it. Sign languages are the only means to communicate
with deaf and dumb people. Without this, they become isolated from the society. We have
gone through different types of techniques for Sign Language Recognition system. Moreover,
we have developed an application for Sign Language Recognition using Leap Motion
Controller which is portable and economical and we overcame the limitations of previous
systems with advantages of delivering accurate results and real-time response capability.

Data collected from Leap Motion Controller are raw and processed and then classified
according to the Machine Learning Algorithms. The data is then converted as Text and
speech for the deaf and mute for easy communication.
